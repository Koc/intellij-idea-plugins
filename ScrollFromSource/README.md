ScrollFromSource
=====================

Today, there is not a shortcut for "Scroll From Source" in Project Panel. So I write the plugin to set the special shortcut for this function. You can set it by any shortcut

Set the keyboard shortcut to the function of "Scroll From Source" in Project Panel.

You can set the special shortcut by yourself to all OS(Window/Linux/Mac)

Default shortcut is Command+Control+S for Mac.
